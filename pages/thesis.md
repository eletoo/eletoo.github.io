### Bachelor's Degree Thesis
#### Analysis and Characterization of Wi-Fi Channel State Information

The thesis is a report on the analysis of **Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)** aiming at characterizing the wireless channel and providing a mathematical model for it working at the timescale of frame transmission.

Channel State Information allows a high-level description of the behaviour of a signal propagating from a transmitter to a receiver. It can be used to perform _ambient sensing_, a technique that extracts relevant information about the surroundings from the signals received. Ambient sensing can already play an essential role in the development of new wireless networks: for instance, 5G New Radio and Beyond 5G networks use it when performing _Joint Communication and Sensing_ and when optimizing signal propagation through _beamforming_.

Despite the widespread use of ambient sensing, there is still a lack of research about the characterization of wireless channels when it comes to using them for purposes other than communication alone, especially focusing on a timescale longer than the typical signal and symbol analysis.

This work analyzes the structure of CSI traces collected in a laboratory and describes their behaviour so as to provide a mathematical interpretation for it that can be used to model the channel at the frame level.

The obtained model can help improve the technical aspects of the implementation of Joint Communication and Sensing in future networks so that it will be possible to efficiently take advantage of the properties of the channels to fulfil the goals that upcoming technologies will set.
